            <summary>What is Genshin?</summary>
            <p>You're right, but Genshin Impact is a brand new open-world adventure game independently developed by miHoYo. The game takes place in a fantasy world called "Teyvat," where individuals chosen by the gods are granted the power of elemental magic through the "Vision" bestowed upon them. You'll play as a mysterious character called the "Traveler," who embarks on a journey to reunite with lost loved ones while uncovering the truth behind the "Genshin."

                As you freely explore this vast world, you'll encounter a diverse cast of companions with unique abilities and personalities. Together, you'll face off against formidable foes and gradually uncover the secrets of "Genshin."
                
                Despite your poor behavior, I can earn 150 Primogems every day just by playing Genshin Impact, which translates to a monthly income of around 5,000 Primogems. In real life, that's equivalent to a monthly income of at least 30,000 RMB, surpassing the level of most people in China, including you. This is the pride that Genshin Impact has given me.
                
                It's not an exaggeration to say that Genshin Impact is miHoYo's most ambitious and expansive project to date. Even after 8,700 hours of challenging gameplay, there are still many secrets yet to be discovered, missed weapons and equipment, as well as spells and skills that have yet to be used.
                
                Although the combat experience in the game is not much different from what we've seen in the "Shaoji" series of games, the meticulously designed enemies and boss battles have elevated the level of combat to new heights. Just like "The Legend of Zelda" several years ago, Genshin Impact is also an outstanding work that can push similar games forward.</p>
